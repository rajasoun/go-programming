# Introduction 

Go
- Born @ Google
- simple, concurrent language
- Cross-compilation
- Go Toolchain
- Binaries!
- Concurrency over parallelism
- Neither Object-oriented nor functional in nature
    * No classes (it does have structs)
    * No inheritance
    * functions can return functions
    * Lack of generics (almost here! -> beta in 1.18)
    * No collect/reduce/fold etc.
        * Though you could implement them yourself 

Go Overview 
- Statically typed, type inferred language
- Pointers (with Memory-safety!)
- Garbage collector
- struct with receiver functions
- Implicit interfaces
- slices & maps
- goroutines
- channels
- Testing and benchmarking
- UTF-8 by default
- Comprehensive standard library...
- and great documentation to go along with it!
- Go-fmt

Go Limitations 

- null pointer exceptions (nil in Go) - Billion dollar mistake!
- No functional programming paradigm (collect/reduce/fold)
- Dealing with errors (return val, err)
- Package Manager
    * Solved very recently - go mod
    * Old projects tend to use dep, glide, ...


Go For Developer Tools 

- Automation and Command-line tools 
- Go is a great tool to make complex automation tools for developers. 
- Its fast, lightweight and follows unix “Do one thing. And do it well.”.

Go For Non System Domains

- Gomobile
- Gobots for IoT
- Go WASM (Web Assembly)
- Go for AI/ML (Using Tenserflow and otherwise too)
- Blockchain
